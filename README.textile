h1. What is it?

Nothing yet. But hopefully it'll be a really cool tool eventually.

h2. Eclipse plug-in & Maven dependencies

h3. Installing on a new development machine

If you are installing this on a fresh copy, then you need to run this command outside of Eclipse in the root directory (with a copy of Maven on your classpath) to copy the dependencies:

$ mvn dependency:copy-dependencies

This will copy all of the relevant dependencies (including SWT, Eclipse, and everything else) to the target/dependency folder, which gets included on the plug-in classpath.

h3. Installing a new dependency 

Do the following:
* Add the dependency to the Maven pom.xml
* Run mvn dependency:copy-dependencies
* Update the jars.extra.classpath to have all of those new jars (including transitive dependencies)
